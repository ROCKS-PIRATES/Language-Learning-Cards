    <h1>Language Learning Cards</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is LLC?</h3>
    <p> <b>Language learning cards</b> are study tools, often in the form of flashcards, designed to help learners memorize and practice new vocabulary, phrases, 
        grammar points, or pronunciation in a foreign language. Each card typically has a prompt on one side—such as a word or phrase in the target language—and 
        the answer or explanation on the other side, like the translation, example sentence, or pronunciation guide. These cards promote active recall and spaced repetition, 
        which are effective techniques for improving memory retention. They can be physical cards or digital, often customizable, portable, and easy to use, making them a popular 
        method for language learners to steadily build their skills.</p>

    <h3>Why do we use?</h3>
    <p>We use language learning cards because they are an effective and convenient way to improve language skills. These cards help learners memorize vocabulary, phrases, and 
        grammar by encouraging active recall—forcing the brain to retrieve information rather than just passively reading it. They also support spaced repetition, which means 
        reviewing information at increasing intervals to strengthen long-term memory. Additionally, language cards are portable and customizable, allowing learners to study 
        anytime, anywhere, and focus on areas they find challenging. Overall, they make language learning more organized, engaging, and efficient.</p>
